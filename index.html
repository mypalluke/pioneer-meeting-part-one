                    <p class="text-lg mt-2">The apostle Paul was surrounded by many hard-working brothers and sisters, yet he felt Timothy stood in a category all his own. As we read Philippians 2:19, 20, look for the specific phrase Paul uses to describe Timothy’s interest in others. Ask yourself: 'Is this the quality people feel when I talk to them?</p>
                    
                    <div class="scripture-box">
                        <p>Read the scripture. Philippians 2:19, 20</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">19 Now I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy+ to you shortly, so that I may be encouraged when I receive news about you. 20 For I have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for your concerns.+</p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="mb-4">When we read Paul’s recommendation of Timothy, we might expect him to list Timothy’s skills as a speaker or his efficiency as an organizer. But as we read Philippians 2:19, 20, what is the only quality Paul highlights, and why do you think that specific quality meant so much to the congregations Timothy served?</p>

                    <div class="bg-blue-50 p-4 border rounded italic text-blue-800">
                        Possible follow up question, if the point is not fully covered:<br>
                        If you were writing a letter of recommendation for a pioneer, you might mention how many studies they have or how well they handle the platform. But looking closely at these verses, does Paul mention Timothy’s 'pioneer skills'—like his speaking ability or organizational talent? What is the only thing Paul highlights here?

                    <p class="mb-2">Timothy traveled, faced dangers, gave up his home:</p>
                    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Love is Active:</strong> Paul didn't highlight Timothy's natural talent, but his willingness to be used. Timothy may or may not have been "naturally disposed" to worry about others, but he chose to expend himself for others genuinely.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>The Difference:</strong> An organizer manages a schedule; a speaker delivers a talk. But someone who willingly expends himself like Timothy carries the burdens of the brothers and sisters as if they were his own.</p>
                    
                    <p class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">What was the result of Timothys genuine care for people in the field?</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>The Result:</strong> That is why the congregations looked forward to his visits. They didn't just feel "taught"; they felt "loved" and "cared for and Paul was moved to mention his deep appreciation for Timothy.</p>

                    <p class="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg border-2 border-yellow-200 text-xl italic mb-6">
                        Dear pioneers, we mention Timothy because you remind us elders so much of him. We see that it isn't just a schedule that keeps you going; it is your heartfelt love for people. Your love is what motivates you to continue despite the trials you face—whether those are health issues, financial pressures, or the freedoms you have willingly given up to stay in the race. Just as Paul was moved by Timothy, we are moved by you. Jehovah sees your acts of kindness and your persistence as a 'sweet fragrance'. Like the congregations of old, our congregation is refreshed because you don't just 'teach' us; you care for us.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Sometimes, let’s be honest, the hour requirement can feel like a sharp poke or a prod. It’s a reality of our service. Think of a cowboy and his horse. A cowboy uses spurs; when used properly, they give a tired horse that little nudge to keep moving. In a sense, our schedule—our goal—can be like that spur. It helps us wake up, get out the door, and get moving when the flesh is weak.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        But what happens if a cowboy relies only on the spur? If he just prods and prods without caring for the horse, the animal will eventually wear out, lose heart, or even revolt. The spur isn't the reason the horse runs; the relationship between the horse and the rider is.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4 font-semibold text-blue-700">
                        We never want the hour requirement to feel like a whip. If we focus only on the number, we will burn out. But when that 'spur' of a schedule gets us to the door, we want our love for Jehovah and the people to take over. It’s that love—the 'genuine concern' Timothy had—that really carries us through the day, not just the pressure of a requirement.
                    </p>

                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 italic">Discussion Question:</p>
                        <p>Ask the group: "Have any of you ever had an experience where you have put forth the extra effort to get up early, or stay out longer because of the effect of being spured on. have you had a good experience that has come as a result?"</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        We’ve seen that love is the real 'engine' that keeps us going when the 'spur' of the hour requirement feels sharp. But to keep that love burning, we have to see people the way Jehovah does. When we look at the people in our territory, do we just see 'doors' to be knocked on to reach a goal, or do we see what the apostle Paul describes here in Romans? Let's look for the 'why' behind our work as we read Romans 10:13-15
                    </p>

                    <div class="scripture-box">
                        <p>For “everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.”+ 14 However, how will they call on him if they have not put faith in him? How, in turn, will they put faith in him about whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach? 15 How, in turn, will they preach unless they have been sent out?+ Just as it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!”+</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        This highlights the desperate necessity of the pioneer's work. When we look at the people in our territory, they aren't just names on a map; they are people who are 'calling out,' even if they don't realize it yet.

                        To see what this looks like in real life, let’s watch this video featuring a pioneer named Suélen and a woman named Ris. As we watch, notice: What challenges did Suélen face in her territory? How did she show genuine interest in Ris? How can we share Jehovah’s view of our territory?

                    <p class="italic text-lg">"It is beautiful to see how Suélen’s love for Ris moved her to expend herself in the field.
