                    <p class="text-lg mt-2">The apostle Paul was surrounded by many hard-working brothers and sisters, yet he felt Timothy stood in a category all his own. As we read Philippians 2:19, 20, look for the specific phrase Paul uses to describe Timothy’s interest in others. Ask yourself: 'Is this the quality people feel when I talk to them?</p>
